The current repository contains my replication of [Joshua D. Angrist, Erich Battistin, and Daniela Vuri (2017)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20160267).

## Replication Angrist et al. (2017)

Angrist et al. (2017) analyse the effect of smaller classes on student achievement using Italian data on INVALSI test scores of second- and fifth graders. They contribute to the long-standing debate on class-size effects by illustrating how in certain settings, characterized by local marking and low accountability, smaller classes can incentivize teachers to manipulate test scores, thereby inflating estimates of class-size effects. By combining Maimonides-IV estimation, first discussed in Angrist and Lavy (1999), with a randomized monitoring experiment, they credibly conclude that reducing classes by 10 students has no effects on student achievement, at least in the Italian setting.

In this project, I replicate the findings of Agrist et al. (2017) and extend their work by means of enhanced visualization.

## This Repository

My replication can be found in the Jupyter notebook [student_project.nbconvert.ipynb](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/microeconometrics-course-project-FedericoAlexanderRizzuto/blob/master/student_project.nbconvert.ipynb). It is best viewed via nbviewer (see the badge above). 
The folders *auxiliary*, *data*, *files* respectively contain auxiliary code (written in Python), the dataset used for my replication, and the causal graph, which may not be rendered in the Jupyter notebook.
